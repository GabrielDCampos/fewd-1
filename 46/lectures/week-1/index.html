<h1>Week 1</h1>

<p>
  This week we'll talk about course logistics and expectations. We'll also go over HTML and CSS basics. With your new found skills you'll publish a very simple course profile page, which will be your ongoing homepage for the course.

<h2 id="expectations">1. Course expectations</h2>

<p>
  This is <em>your course</em>. So you decide how much you want to get out of it and how much you're willing to put in. In general, this is what success looks like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bringing your best to classâ€”<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3504-you-play-like-you-practice">"you play like you practice"</a></li>
  <li>Can't is not spoken here, fake it till you make it</li>
  <li>Missing no more than two classes</li>
  <li>Doing all your homework</li>
  <li>Taking written notes during lecturesâ€”these lecture notes will only give you an overview but will leave a lot of questions unanswered</li>
  <li>Helping other students with topics you understand</li>
  <li>Presenting a final project on the last day</li>
  <li>Complete exit tickets after each lesson</li>
  <li>Complete mid &amp; end-of-course surveys</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Notice that success is not defined by the quality of your work. You're not here to learn everything about how to build web applications. Some people learn material faster than others. Some people have more prior knowledge than others. So define your own expectations of success.
</p>

<p>
  One thing is for sure: the more work you do, the better you'll get.
</p>

<h3>Missing a class</h3>

<p>
  If you have to miss a class, no problem, just let the instructional team know ahead of time. Try and schedule a time with someone to review the material you will have missed.
</p>

<h2 id="slack">2. Slack</h2>

<div class="sidebar">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://slack.com/downloads">Download Slack</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../../resources/slack.html">More info</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  All course communication will happen on Slack. So it's critical to make sure you're set up and receiving notifications.
</p>

<p>
  Slack is designed to help us all communicate and stay on the same page but it a perfect tool and it has some drawbacks. Jason Fried, CEO at Basecamp, discusses some of the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.eb9dl1gvj">pros/cons of group chat</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some ground rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong style="color: green">Yes to:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking a few minutes to make sure your notifications are configured so you receive the right notifications (especially #announcements)</li>
      <li>Self-coordinating study groups</li>
      <li>Posting notes and whiteboard pictures</li>
      <li>Reaching out to the instructional team for help (#help)</li>
      <li>Proper grammar and correct use of code blocks</li>
      <li>Emojis ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong style="color: red">No to:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Chatting during lectures</li>
      <li>Talking about other people</li>
      <li>Distracting GIFs and videos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chrome">3. Chrome</h2>

<div class="sidebar">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">Download Chrome</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">Dev Tools</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  Chrome is the browser we're going to be using throughout the course.
</p>

<h2 id="atom">4. Atom</h2>

<div class="sidebar">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://atom.io">Download Atom</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../../resources/atom.html">Configure Atom</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../../resources/keyboard-shortcuts.html">Keyboard shortcuts</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  To write code you need a text editor. Atom is the text editor of choice for this class. You're welcome to use something else but your own if you get stuck.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why do we use a text editor? As opposed to, say, Google Docs or Word?</li>
  <li>What does WYSIWYG mean?</li>
  <li>If I can't control formatting with UI controls, how will I do it?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Your editor helps you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keep indentation under control</li>
  <li>Spot errors before you save and run your code</li>
  <li>Search, find, and replace across multiple files</li>
  <li>See all the files in your project</li>
  <li>Type less</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="github">5. GitHub</h2>

<h3>What is "source control?"</h3>

<a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">
  <img src="images/git-branching.png" class="supporting-image">
</a>

<p>
  Source control is a system of managing the code we write. We don't just write code and leave it forever. When you want to make an improvement or fix a bug, you have to edit code you've written. Using source control makes that process easier, especially when working on a team.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you're a designer or writer, how do you version your files?
    <ul>
      <li>What's good about that system?</li>
      <li>What's bad about that system?</li>
      <li>What happens when you're dealing with huge files, like videos?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    What happens when you want to work on multiple things at once?
  </li>
  <li>
    What are some other flavors of source control?
  </li>
  <li>
    What's a "repository?"
  </li>
  <li>
    What's a "commit?"
  </li>
  <li>
    What's a "diff?"
  </li>
  <li>
    What's a "branch?"
  </li>
  <li>
    What's the difference between git and GitHub?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is git actually doing under the hood?
  </li>
  <li>
    What's the deal with <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="html">6. Intro to HTML</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What is HTML?</li>
  <li>What is a markup language? As opposed to, say, a programming language?</li>
</ul>

<h3>"Hello World"</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Confirm that you have not created any repos on GitHub thus far</li>
  <li>Create a new folder "fewd-46"</li>
  <li>Open that folder in Atom</li>
  <li>Create a file in that folder "index.html"</li>
  <li>Add the folder to GitHub, which will make it a repository</li>
  <li>Make your first commit!</li>
  <li>Publish to GitHub</li>
  <li>View your repo on GitHub</li>
  <li>"Cut" a branch called "gh-pages" and <strong>publish</strong> it to GitHub</li>
  <li>
    See your page at <code>http://{ your user name }.github.io/{ your repository name }/</code> for example:
    <a href="http://avand.github.io/fewd">http://avand.github.io/fewd/</a>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>The anatomy of an element</h3>

<img src="images/anatomy-of-an-html-element.jpg" width="400" class="supporting-image">

<p>
  At its most essential, an element consists of an opening and a closing <em>tag</em>. Some tags don't close but we'll get to that in a minute.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Opening tag:</strong> Tells the browser that you're about to start describing some sort of content. It could be a paragraph, or a link, or anything that a browser understands.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Content:</strong> The stuff you're describing! Usually this ends up being the words on the page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Closing tag:</strong> When you're done with the <em>content</em>, you just match the opening tag with a closing tag.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Practice: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>.
</p>

<h3>Nesting tags</h3>

<img src="images/simple-document-tree.png" class="supporting-image">

<p>
  Elements can be nested. And, in practice, that's a critical part of HTML. We refer to the whole page, or the entire HTML file as the <strong>document</strong>. And, as you can see, it forms a tree. There are rules about what elements can go inside other elements but it's not strongly enforced and mostly obvious.
</p>

<p>
  Practice: <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.
</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>

<img src="images/element-attributes.png" class="supporting-image">

<p>
  How would you go about linking to something? Even if you knew the element's tag was: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. Where would you put the link?
</p>

<p>
  A complete list of all tags and their attributes can be found on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN): <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">HTML element reference</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Practice: <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.
</p>

<h3>Putting it all together: create a profile</h3>

<img src="images/profile-example.png" class="supporting-image">

<p>
  Let's put it all together to create a profile page that will live for the life of this course and probably beyond. Eventually you'll pull all your homework assignments here and anything else you want to show off.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Download a picture of you and put it in the same folder as your repo/project
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit index.html to include
    <ul>
      <li>Your name</li>
      <li>The image of you (if the file is called "me.jpg" then your image element should like like this: <code>&lt;img src="me.jpg"&gt;</code>)</li>
      <li>A short bio-paragrah</li>
      <li>Links to your various online profiles</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Save, commit, and sync
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Some important keyboard shortcuts</h3>

<p>
  When writing HTML there are two keyboard shortcuts you should use all the time:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Command + Option + . will close the last opened tag</li>
  <li>Any tag name + Tab will stub out that tag for you</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Try it. Note that for these to work, you must see "HTML" in the lower right of Atom.
</p>

<p>
  A complete list of shortcuts is available <a href="../../../resources/keyboard-shortcuts.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="homework">7. Submitting homework</h2>

<p>
  You'll submit your homework by making a pull request that links up your project to this course homepage. Feedback will be provided on the Pull Request.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    "Fork" the course curriculum repo: <a href="https://github.com/avand/fewd">github.com/avand/fewd</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Clone the repo in GitHub Desktop
  </li>
  <li>
