    <h1>Avandâ€™s Front-end Web Development</h1>

    <p>
      Hey there! Youâ€™ve just stumbled upon Avandâ€™s front-end web development
      curriculum designed for use at General Assembly in San Francisco.
    </p>

    <p>
      More information about the course is available at
      <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development">
        General Assembly</a>. And more information about Avand is available

    <h2>Final Projects</h2>

    <p>
      Everyone always wants to know, "what will I build?" Good question.
      Previous students have built all kinds of projects: games, quizzes,
      portfolio websites, search engines, and maps. You'll find examples here:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="37">Section 37 Final Projects</a>: Scroll down and follow the
        links under the "Final Project" column on the right for each student.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://bit.ly/fewd-finals">Avand's compilation</a>: Sadly,
        many of these projects have collected dust over the years and may no
        longer function but a few still work. It should give you an idea of the
        type of work you can do in this course.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/FEWD?metro=san-francisco">GA's
        Gallery</a>: GA has been collecting the "best-of" final projects from
        all the FEWD instances.
